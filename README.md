#Minimum Energy Configuration with Polygon Boundary

This script attempts to find the minimum energy configuration of a number of charged particles, which are contrained tinside a box, inside which lies an arbitrary polygon. The solver uses simulated annealing to find the minimum energy configuration, although for convex polygons it would be possible to use NR or something similar.
